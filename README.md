# Module-3-Capstone-Josh-Fork

National Park demo site.

Uses Java, Spring MVC, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap + custom CSS.

Primary functionality completed with Christopher Clark as part of Team 5 for the Module 3 Capstone Project at Tech Elevator, July 2019.

This fork has been restyled and has some responsive styling on the homepage. Other pages could use this (and other styling) as well.
