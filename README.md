# Tech Elevator Module 3 Capstone: Josh Fork

National Park demo site.

Uses Java, Spring MVC, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap + custom CSS.

Displays images, park name, and description on the home page. User can click on an image to visit a page with additional park information, including weather predictions and advisories based on conditions. The conditional logic should really be in the model rather than the view.

Primary functionality completed with Christopher Clark as part of Team 5 for the Module 3 Capstone Project at Tech Elevator, July 2019.

This fork has been restyled and has some responsive styling on the homepage. Other pages could use this (and other styling), as well.
